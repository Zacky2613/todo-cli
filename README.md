# todo-cli

A python application tool to handle your tasks straight from the command line.

## Usage

There are 3 categories which are todo, doing, and done. The following commands are how to interact with them

### Add Task

Add a task to one of the categories

Example: `[*] Task: todo update README.md file`

### Move Task

Move a task from one category to another by task id (the 0)

Example: `[*] Task: todo 0 doing`

### Clear category

Clear a category in its entirety.

Example: `[*] Category: todo`

### Clear all 

Just the input and it clears all

## Fork

This is inspired off of <a href="https://github.com/kennxdy/doddot">kennxdy's doddot project.</a>
However, I have completely rewritten all the code and made it much nicer to read with clearer documentation and made it much more responsive.
